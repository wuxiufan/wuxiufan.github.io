My name is Xiufan Wu. I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I study comparative politics, and my research focuses on the state formation and state-building processes of the modern East Asian states (especially China) during the early half of the twentieth century. Aside from my thesis, my research interest also covers contemporary Chinese politics, historical political economy, government-organized non-governmental organizations, Chinese Foreign Policies, as well as the modern history of China and Japan.

Before coming to the University of Minnesota, I spent a year studying at the University of Oxford's Department of Politics and International Relations. I also worked as a research assistant at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, focusing on Environmental NGOs’ policy advocacy in China. I completed my Master’s Degree in International Relations at the University of Chicago with honors; before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in foreign services from Georgetown University, majoring in international politics with a concentration on international law and organizations. I am fluent in Mandarin Chinese, English, and Japanese.
